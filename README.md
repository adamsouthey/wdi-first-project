Installation Instructions
Download or clone the Github repo: https://github.com/adamsouthey/wdi-first-project

Challenges
Using setTimeout instead of clearInterval caused time penalties to carry over and stack following a level restart.

Using jQuery's data() api to retrieve all the data attribute of an element. Using jQuery .data() for dynamically setting data attributes. Used the DOM instead or jQuery .attr()

I initially tried to set the level of difficulty to multiple buttons via multiple event listeners. This was inefficient and decided to create an object containing key value pairs relating to difficulty.

Improvements
Due to time restraints CSS was sacrificed for this project.

The UI could be more user friendly.

I would like to include more levels of difficulty.

Drier code with more comments to help other developers understand my thought process.
