# Challenges
Using setTimeout instead of clearInterval caused time penalties to carry over and stack following a level restart.

Using jQuery's data() api to retrieve all the data attribute of an element. Using jQuery .data() for dynamically setting data attributes. Used the DOM instead or jQuery .attr()

I initially tried to set the level of difficulty to multiple buttons via multiple event listeners. This was inefficient and decided to create an object containing key value pairs relating to difficulty.


# Improvements
Due to time restraints CSS was sacrificed for this project.

The UI could be more user friendly.

I would like to include more levels of difficulty perhaps following an incorrect guess have the two card elements switch places and flip back over.

Drier code with more comments to help other developers understand my thought process.

I would like to include a level up button when the user completes a level, rather than having to return to the homepage and select the next level.
